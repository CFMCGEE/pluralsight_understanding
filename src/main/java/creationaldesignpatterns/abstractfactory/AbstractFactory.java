                          Abstract Factory Class (Creational Design Pattern)
                          - Factory of (similar) Factories
                          - Facotry of related objects
                          - Common Interface
                          - Defer to Subclasses
                          - Implemented with a Factory (but doesn't have to be)
                          - Hides the Factory
                          - Abstracts Environment
                          - Built through Composition
                          - Complex
                          - Heavily abstraction
                          - Framework pattern
                          - Examples:
                           - DocumentBuilder
                           - Frameworks

                          Design
                          - Groups Factories together
                          - Factory is responsible for lifecycle
                          - Common Interface
                          - Create Classes
                          - Parameterized create method
                          - Composition
