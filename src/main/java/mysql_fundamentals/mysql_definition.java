                                    - Relational Database is a collection of data items organized as a set that includes tables and keys.
                                    - Open Source

                                    MySQL Workbench

                                     - ERR Model
                                     - Reverse Engineering
                                    - Server Administration
                                     - [Start or Stop] MySQL Server
                                     - MySQL Monitor

                                    Client/Server System
                                    - Clients are like PCs, Macs, laptops, tables, smartphones, etc.
                                    - Server stores files and database (database server)
                                    - Networks are communications links between client and server
                                     - It also includes other interface components like hubs and routers.
                                     - Networking components connect server with network storage
                                     - Clients and servers typically are on the same network (known as LAN or local area network)
                                     - If there are more than two LANs located in separate geography location, that's called a WAN or wide area network

                                    Web Application Server
                                    - ISP (Internet Server Provider)
                                    - The front end of any application is stored in the application server
                                    - Every request for data goes into a database server
                                     - Database servers have a DBMS or database management system.

                                    Relational Database Model Concepts (and Model Keys)
                                    - Tables
                                     - A real world entity e.g Address
                                     - Columns (Fields)
                                      - Attribute of the entity e.g Street #, City, Zipcode
                                      - Data type determines the type of information
                                       - String (Char, Varchar)
                                       - Integer (Int)
                                       - Float
                                       - Data and time (Date)
                                      - Default Value
                                      - Nullable column (Column containing a null value)
                                      - Auto increment column
                                     - Rows (Records)
                                      - Set of values for a single instance of entity e.g A single address
                                     - Cells
                                      - Intersection of a row and a column
                                      - Has a single value
                                     - Primary Key
                                      - Unique identifier of row
                                      - One per table
                                      - Does not allow null
                                      - Single or multiple columns (composite columns)
                                     - Unique Key
                                      - Ensures data is not duplicate
                                      - More than one per table
                                      - Allows one null
                                     - Foreign Key
                                      - Columns in a table that refer to a Primary Key of another table
                                      - Enforces referential integrity
                                      - One-to-one & One-to-many relationship
