                        Bridge Class (Structural Design Pattern)
                        - Decouple Abstraction & Implementation
                        - Encapsulation, Composition, Inheritance
                        - Changes in Abstraction won't affect client
                        - Details won't be right to begin with
                        - Designed upfront
                        - Abstraction and implementation vary
                        - Built in advance
                        - Complex
                        - Designed for uncertainty
                        - Provides flexibility
                        - Much more than Composition
                        - Examples:
                         - Driver
                         - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

                        Design
                        - Interfaces and Abstract classes
                        - Composition over Inheritance
                        - More than Composition
                        - Expect change from both sides
