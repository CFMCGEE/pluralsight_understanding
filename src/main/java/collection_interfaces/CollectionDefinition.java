                        Collection Framework


      Collection: An interface that has a general container for any Java Objects
      Collection Interface [
      List Interface: ([
       An ordered group of values that are indexed numerically
       ]
       Lists can hold any Type of Object
       Lists can't be initialized...
       You can, however, initialize implementation of another list:
       ArrayList:
       Order - insertion order is preserved (insertion order of the values)
       LinkedList:
       Order - insertion order is preserved (insertion order of the values) [not gone over]
       Vector:
       Order - insertion order is preserved (insertion order of the values) [not gone over]
       Stack:
       Order - [not gone over]
       )
      Set Interface: ([
       A group of unique values without an index
       ]
       Sets can hold any Type of Object
       Sets DO NOT allow Duplicates
       Sets can't be initialized...
       You can, however, initialize implementation of another set:
       HashSet:
       Order - no order is guaranteed
       TreeSet:
       Order - additions are sorted alphabetically by value
       EnumSet:
       Order - the order in which they are declared [not gone over]
       )
      Map Interface: ([
       An unordered group key value pairs that are indexed by a key
      ]
      Maps can hold any Type of Object
      Maps can't be initialized...
      You can, however, initialize implementation of another map:
      HashMap:
      Order - no order is guaranteed
      TreeMap:
      Order - elements are in sorted order by key alphanumerically (or alphabetically)
      LinkedHashMap:
      Order - insertion order is preserved (insertion order of the values)
      )
      ]

                         What are lists?

      Lists are values that indexed numerically - [values, indices]

      Comparison: List v Map
      Lists are values that indexed numerically - [values, indices]
      Maps are in pairs of keys and values - [keys, values]

      Comparison: List v Set
      Lists are values that indexed numerically - [values, indices]
      Sets are unique values without an index - [values]
